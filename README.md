# Unconditional Diffusion Model
This is the code repository for generating Super Mario Bros. levels using the unconditional diffusion model.

## Neural A*
The Neural A* training codes were added to generate potential paths for levels. At this stage, Neural A* is not implemented as part of the diffusion model.
